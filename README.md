# firestorm-mods

Temporary repository for some modifications to the Firestorm virtual world viewer

The sources for Firestorm are maintained elsewhere, with Mecurial.  This is temporary storage for some fixes under
development. The changes are intended to work around some problems in the simulator by adding some sanity checks
to the viewer for motion that crosses sim boundaries. In time, these should be merged back into the Mecurial
mainstream.
